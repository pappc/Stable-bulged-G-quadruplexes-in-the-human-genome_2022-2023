This document provides details for the processed data sets uploaded in this folder. 

These are:
cG4_L7.Hg38.uniq.no_repEle.merged.txt
g4bs.Hg38.uniq.G2B2.no_repEle.merged.txt
g4bs.Hg38.uniq.G3B1.no_repEle.merged.txt
g4bs.Hg38.uniq.G3B2.no_repEle.merged.txt
g4bs.Hg38.uniq.no_repEle.merged.txt

All data sets underwent the same processing steps:
- All genomic coordinates in these data sets refer to genome assembly hg38
- overlaps between each "g4bs" data set and cG4_L7.Hg38.uniq.no_repEle.merged.txt were removed, resulting in unique (non-overlapping) genomic regions in all data sets
- genomic regions overlapping with any human repeat element were removed 
(repeat elements data set was downloaded from: Repeating Elements by RepeatMasker, https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTrackUi?g=rmsk)
- in each given data set overlapping regions were merged together using the bedtools merge function of the bedtools toolbox
- Data sets "g4bs.Hg38.uniq.G2B2.no_repEle.merged.txt", "g4bs.Hg38.uniq.G3B1.no_repEle.merged.txt" and "g4bs.Hg38.uniq.G3B2.no_repEle.merged.txt" contain potential bulged 
  G-quadruplex forming sequence (pG4-BS) model specific merged regions (e.g., G3B1, G3B2, G2B2). The number following "G" refers to the number of intact stem regions,
  while the number following "B" refers to the number of bulge sites in the sequence. For more detailed explanation please see the associated publication. 
- The data set "g4bs.Hg38.uniq.no_repEle.merged.txt" contains genomic regions where overlapping pG4-BS motifs were merged together in a non-model-specific manner 
  (e.g., motifs belonging to different models may be merged together into pG4-BS regions in this data set).
